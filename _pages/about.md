<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently working at **DAMO Academy, Alibaba Group** as a research scientist.

Before this, I received my Bachelor’s degree (2017-2021, computer science), Master's degree (2021-2024, computer science) from **Shandong University** and **Xiamen University**, respectively.

🤔 Currently, my research interests are primarily focused on Large Language Models (LLMs), covering the following topics:
- **Knowledge-Augmented LLMs** allow LLMs to make full use of external knowledge to solve real-world problems
- **LLM-Agent** that creates interfaces to help LLMs and humans communicate, interact, and exchange knowledge. I believe all these questions are fundamental for bridging the gap between LLMs and human intelligence, and their solutions will play significant roles in implementing a knowledge-centric AI.
- **Large-Vision Language Models (LVLMs)** that enables LVLMs to better understand images, comprehend user intent, and mitigate hallucination issues in LVLMs.


🤝 **Looking for a Fall 2025 Ph.D. position at 🇺🇸. If you are interested in working with me, please drop me an email.**
